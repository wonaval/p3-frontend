REQUIREMENTS:
Your pitch is due Tuesday 12/14/21 by noon PST. Make two repos for this project in your own personal github, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Make a README.md in either one; this README will contain your pitch. Your README should contain:

<p>Title of the project (biggest header in the document)</p>

<p>Overview: summarize the goals of your app, and describe the problem your app is built to solve.</p>

<p>Wireframes: Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Take a screenshot and link to the images in your readme. Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.</p>

<p>User stories: a series of statements in the form of "When I {do X}, {Y happens}." These statements should encompass the whole functionality of your app.
Routes inventory: list all the routes you plan to have in your backend. Include the http verb, the path, and a brief summary of what the route does. (To represent this nicely in markdown, you might want to look up how to make a table in a markdown file!)</p>

<p>Database ERD: diagram all your tables, columns, and associations. You can use a tool like this https://app.dbdesigner.net/designer/schema/new, and screencap the image.</p>

<p>Frontend components tree: Diagram out your component hierarchy, indicating which components are parents/children of which others. Indicate which components hold which pieces of state, and which props are passed to each child.</p>

<p>MVP checklist: A list of all the functionalities that will constitute the bare minimum version of your app. Note that this list should be sized so that you can complete it by ~Monday, leaving Tuesday to tackle stretch goals.</p>

<p>Stretch goals: A list of awesome bonus goals you will work on after completing your MVP.</p>
