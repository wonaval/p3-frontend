# PROJECT TITLE: TBA

### OVERVIEW
<p>Summarize the goals of your app, and describe the problem your app is built to solve.</p>

---

### WIREFRAMES
<p>Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Take a screenshot and link to the images in your readme. Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.</p>

---

### USER STORIES
<p>Series of statements in the form of "When I {do X}, {Y happens}." These statements should encompass the whole functionality of your app.</p>

---

### ROUTE INVENTORY
<p>List all the routes you plan to have in your backend. Include the http verb, the path, and a brief summary of what the route does. (To represent this nicely in markdown, you might want to look up how to make a table in a markdown file!)</p>

---

### DATABASE ERD
<p>Diagram all your tables, columns, and associations. You can use a tool like this https://app.dbdesigner.net/designer/schema/new, and screencap the image.</p>

---

### COMPONENT TREE
<p>Diagram out your component hierarchy, indicating which components are parents/children of which others. Indicate which components hold which pieces of state, and which props are passed to each child.</p>

---

### MVP CHECKLIST
<p>List of all the functionalities that will constitute the bare minimum version of your app. Note that this list should be sized so that you can complete it by ~Monday, leaving Tuesday to tackle stretch goals.</p>

---

### STRETCH GOALS
<p>List of awesome bonus goals you will work on after completing your MVP.</p>
